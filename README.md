# MARL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning)
This will be a general solution for learning behaviors in a continuous state space.
In this initial release it is specifically designed to use environments built in the Unity ML-Agents framework.
Eventually, I will generalize this to use a non-specific simulation environment.
